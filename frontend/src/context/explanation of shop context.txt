Explanation of ShopContext.jsx

Imports
import { createContext } from 'react';
import { products } from '../assets/assets';

- createContext is a function from React that creates a Context object. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- products is imported from a local file. This likely contains an array or object of product data.

Creating the Context
export const shopContext = createContext();

- shopContext is created using createContext(). This will be used to provide and consume the context in the component tree.

Context Provider Component
const shopContextProvider = (props) => {

- shopContextProvider is a functional component that will wrap around other components to provide them with the context values.

Defining Context Values
    const currency = 'â‚¹';
    const delivery_fee = 40;
    
    const value = {
        products, currency, delivery_fee
    }

- currency and delivery_fee are constants defined within the provider.
- value is an object that contains products, currency, and delivery_fee. This object will be passed down through the context.

Providing Context
    return(
        <shopContext.Provider value={value}>
            {props.children}
        </shopContext.Provider>
    )

- The shopContext.Provider component is used to wrap props.children, which represents any child components.
- The value object is passed to the Provider's value prop, making it available to any component that consumes this context.

Exporting the Provider
export default shopContextProvider;

- shopContextProvider is exported as the default export, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

Summary
This code sets up a React Context for a shop, providing product data, currency, and delivery fee to any components that need it. The shopContextProvider component wraps around other components to make these values accessible throughout the component tree.
